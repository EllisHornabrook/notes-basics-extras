### What is TypeScript?
- A superset of Javascript
- Developed by Microsoft (designed for the developemnt of large projects)
  - Anything you can do in JS you can do in TS
- Compile it into plain JS
- We can integrate it into normal JS projects

### What does it offer?
- Static Type checking
  - Can check and assign variable, parameter and function types
  - Completely optional... but it does improve the readability of our code + more descriptive
- Has all the es6 features (let, const, arrow functions etc.)
- Syntax that is closer to other high level languages (e.g. Java)

### Types
- String, Number, Boolean, Array
- Any... can be any type
- Void... no type returned
- Null... specified absence of value
- Tuple... array with a fixed number of elements (immutable)
- Enum, Generics
